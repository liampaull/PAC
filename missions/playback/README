run ./playback_launch.sh for each vehicle and select the appropriate moos file and moos port etc in uPlayback

run ./sim_shoreside_launch.sh and the pMarineViewer pops up (it will be in an error state because node reports are missing data.. that's ok)

Hit run on the uPlayback windows  

use the value of GROUND_TRUTH in the plugs/pCoverageMap.plug to toggle whether to use the ground truth (GPS) to generate the coverage map or the actual uncertain pose data to generate a probabilistic coverage map.

To save the current coverage map:
uPokeDB SAVE_COVERAGE_MAP=filename.csv
then enter the url (most probably localhost) and the port
