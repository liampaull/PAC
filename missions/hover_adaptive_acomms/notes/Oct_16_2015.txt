Final run is best yet?

1) On restart, in current config make sure to restart frontseat also (MOOSDB is there) to get timings correct for scheduling acomms messages. 
2) There are still gaps occuring in the coverage map causing problems - why since (active) trajectories are short? 
3) when vehicles get to very south part of river there appears to be a problem where a big drift occurs between exp and rtk. Is it because we are not getting rtk or there is a jump between rtk and gps or something? Could make the workspace shorter?
4) Active trajectories get quite short near the end
5) Could make sensor swath narrower (will need to do something to fit 3 vehicles in I think)
